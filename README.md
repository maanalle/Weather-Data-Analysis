# About The Project
This project analyzes weather data to uncover patterns and insights related to temperature, wind speed, visibility, and weather conditions. The goal is to present the data in a user-friendly and visually appealing manner using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib

# About The Data
The dataset contains the following features:<br>

-Temp_C: Temperature in Celsius.<br>
-Wind Speed_km/h: Wind speed in kilometers per hour.<br>
-Visibility_km: Visibility in kilometers.<br>
-Weather Condition: Descriptions of weather conditions such as Clear, Snow, Rain, etc.<br>
-The dataset helps in understanding relationships between different weather parameters and trends.<br>

#Technology Stack
This project uses the following technologies:<br>

<h3>Python: Programming language.</h3><br>
-Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.<br>
-Seaborn: Data visualization.<br>
-Matplotlib: Plotting graphs and charts.<br>
<br>
