# About The Project
This project analyzes weather data to uncover patterns and insights related to temperature, wind speed, visibility, and weather conditions. The goal is to present the data in a user-friendly and visually appealing manner using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib

# About The Data
The dataset contains the following features:<br>

-Temp_C: Temperature in Celsius.<br>
-Wind Speed_km/h: Wind speed in kilometers per hour.<br>
-Visibility_km: Visibility in kilometers.<br>
-Weather Condition: Descriptions of weather conditions such as Clear, Snow, Rain, etc.<br>
-The dataset helps in understanding relationships between different weather parameters and trends.<br>

#Technology Stack
This project uses the following technologies:<br>

<h3>Python: Programming language.</h3><br>
-Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.<br>
-Seaborn: Data visualization.<br>
-Matplotlib: Plotting graphs and charts.<br>
<br>


<h4>Running the Notebook</h4><br>
1-Ensure you have Jupyter /Collab Notebook or JupyterLab installed.<br>
2-Launch Jupyter/Collab Notebook:<br>jupyter notebook<br>
3-Open the Weather Data Analysis.ipynb file and run the cells sequentially.<br>

#Usage and Visualizations<br>
This section contains an overview of the visualizations included in the project:<br>

-Temperature Distribution: Analyze the frequency and spread of temperature values.<br>
-Weather Condition Frequency: Visualize the occurrences of different weather conditions.<br>
-Wind Speed by Weather Condition: Understand the variation of wind speed across weather types.<br>
-Correlation Heatmap: Explore relationships between numerical features like temperature, visibility, and wind speed.<br>
